One small frustration I've often experienced while using navigation apps is the delay in figuring out which direction to head when I first start the route. I’d open the app, enter my destination, and hit "Go"—but then I'd just stand there, stuck, waiting for the app to figure out which way I was facing. Sometimes, I’d end up turning the wrong way, especially in urgent situations. That small moment of uncertainty always felt more disruptive than it should be.

It made me wonder: why can't navigation apps just *know* where we're facing from the very beginning? That simple question led me to an idea I now call **Prenavigation**.

## What If Navigation Started Before We Did?

Prenavigation is based on a simple shift in timing: what if GPS tracking started before we pressed "navigate"? In most apps, GPS kicks in once the route calculation begins—but what if the system was already quietly tracking our location a minute earlier, during the time we spend searching for a destination? That way, by the time we’re ready to move, the app is ready too—with direction, orientation, and confidence.

This wouldn’t require a complete rework of GPS or positioning systems. It’s more about how and when those systems are activated. Today’s smartphones already have tools like GPS and digital compasses (positioning pointers). If those two streams of data could be blended early on—location from GPS, direction from the pointer—the app could instantly determine not just *where* you are, but *which way* you’re facing, without needing you to walk a few steps to clarify things.

## Why It Matters

The beauty of this idea is in its simplicity. Prenavigation could reduce hesitation and confusion, especially in unfamiliar areas or tight timeframes. It's the kind of fix that feels small but meaningful—something that smooths the experience without needing a flashy interface update.

But thinking it through also made me aware of the trade-offs. If we allow apps to begin location tracking even before we start a route, that introduces a privacy concern: it means sharing our location data a little earlier and possibly more frequently. Would users be okay with that? Would developers need to add new settings or permissions to make it transparent?

Another limitation is technical. This idea works best when GPS accuracy is high—but ironically, the places where instant direction is most needed are often indoors or in complex environments like underground garages or crowded city corners, where GPS can struggle. To make it truly reliable, the system might need to integrate something like China’s BeiDou satellite network, which offers greater precision in certain areas.

## A Small Shift in Timing, A Big Improvement in Flow

Reflecting on all this, I’m reminded how many of the best user experience ideas come from moments of friction. We accept these little stumbles—like waiting for a direction to settle—as “just the way it is.” But sometimes, rethinking *when* a tool starts working, not *how*, can make all the difference.

Prenavigation might not be a major revolution in tech, but it’s a small reframing that could make navigation feel smoother, smarter, and more human. And for me, it’s a reminder to always pay attention to the tiny delays in life—because they often hold clues to the next idea worth exploring.

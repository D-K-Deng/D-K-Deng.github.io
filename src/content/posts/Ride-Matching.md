## Introduction

In the complex landscape of urban transportation, efficiently matching drivers with passengers remains a significant challenge, especially in densely populated cities like New York. This project, "NotUber" (NU), aims to address this challenge by creating a sophisticated ride-matching system. The primary goals are to reduce passenger wait times, maximize driver profits, and enhance operational efficiency.

## Background and Problem Statement

Urban transportation is characterized by fluctuating demand, variable traffic conditions, and diverse passenger needs. Traditional taxi services and modern ride-sharing platforms often face inefficiencies, leading to issues like prolonged wait times and suboptimal routing. This project focuses on overcoming these challenges by developing algorithms capable of dynamic, real-time driver-passenger matching, tailored to the urban environment.

## Solution Approach and Methodologies

The project explores various algorithms, each offering a unique strategy for efficient ride-matching:

   - Focus: Rapid response based on a first-come-first-serve principle.
   - Objective: Establish a baseline for algorithm performance comparison.

2. **ImprovedBaselineAlgorithm:**
   - Focus: Matching the nearest driver to a passenger.
   - Objective: Reduce wait times and optimize driver allocation.

3. **EstimateTimeAlgorithm:**

   - Objective: Optimize both driver profit and passenger experience.

### Implementation and Data Handling

The project utilized real-world data, including New York City's road networks and traffic patterns, to create a graph representation of the city. This graph formed the basis for the pathfinding algorithms and ride-matching simulations.

## Insights and Findings

Key insights from the project include:

  - Finding: Zone-based resource management effectively balanced supply and demand.
  - Implication: Directing drivers towards high-demand areas can reduce wait times.

- **Graph-based Modeling:**
  - Finding: Modeling the road network as a graph facilitated accurate, dynamic pathfinding.
  - Implication: Real-time traffic data enhances the model's relevance and accuracy.

- **Data Processing Techniques:**
  - Finding: Robust data processing was crucial for realistic algorithm testing.
  - Implication: Effective handling of large datasets is key to simulation realism.

- **Advanced Pathfinding Algorithms:**
  - Finding: Adapted Dijkstra's and A* algorithms considered real-time traffic conditions.
  - Implication: These algorithms increased the accuracy of travel time calculations.

## Conclusions

The project offers a comprehensive solution for real-time ride-matching in urban environments. By integrating advanced algorithms with spatial data structures and real-time traffic data, the system significantly improves upon traditional methods. It underscores the importance of algorithmic efficiency and data processing in understanding urban transportation dynamics.

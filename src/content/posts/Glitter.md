As the prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) continues to grow, practitioners and caregivers are constantly seeking innovative tools to enhance behavioral interventions. Enter Glitter, an LLM-powered virtual agent specifically designed to support Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) interventions for autistic children. Built through an iterative design process with real-world input, Glitter represents a novel approach to digital behavioral health, providing a combination of self-directed learning and real-time conversational support.

#### Addressing the Challenges in Autism Interventions

The need for effective interventions in ASD is paramount, as autistic children often display a wide range of behaviors and social challenges. While ABA has long been a cornerstone in managing these behaviors, practitioners and caregivers frequently face barriers in consistently applying these techniques across diverse real-life scenarios. Glitter was developed to address these issues by integrating a structured ABA framework within a digital platform, offering tailored guidance and self-paced learning modules.

#### The Concept Behind Glitter

Glitter was designed through a three-round iterative process involving parents and practitioners. The goal was to understand the existing challenges and expectations surrounding behavioral interventions for autistic children. The development process resulted in a two-module system: a Self-Directed Learning (SDL) module and a conversational LLM agent that provides personalized, real-time support.

The SDL module is structured around the Behavior-Antecedent-Behavior-Consequence (BABC) analysis framework. It includes interactive units on various intervention topics such as communication, life skills, and emotional management. This approach ensures users can gain a deep understanding of intervention strategies through case studies, quizzes, and simulated scenarios.

#### Conversational Support with an LLM Agent

The LLM agent in Glitter acts as a virtual assistant, capable of responding to queries using voice or text. It offers advice on behavioral interventions, structured around four key dialogue stages: identifying the issue, understanding the child’s motivation, assessing their abilities, and recommending tailored strategies. This conversational approach mimics real-world interactions between special education teachers and caregivers, making the guidance feel more personalized.

The agent’s responses are grounded in a dataset comprising ABA strategies, examples of common behaviors, and motivational factors. By using prompt engineering, the system delivers relevant and practical advice while encouraging iterative dialogue for refining strategies.

#### Insights from a One-Week Field Study

To validate Glitter's effectiveness, a one-week field study was conducted with 11 practitioners specializing in autism interventions. The study revealed that practitioners found the platform to be a valuable resource for learning and applying ABA strategies. Three primary use case scenarios emerged:

1. **Inquire & Resolve**: Practitioners used the LLM agent to find detailed answers and high-level intervention strategies for unresolved issues.
2. **Compare & Improve**: The platform allowed practitioners to compare Glitter's suggestions with their own strategies, helping them refine their approach.
3. **Prepare & Conclude**: The agent was used as a preparatory tool for upcoming lessons and as a resource for summarizing teaching materials.

#### Practitioners’ Feedback on Glitter’s Design

The multi-modality features of Glitter—combining text, speech, and visual cues—added layers to the user experience. Practitioners noted that the agent’s voice provided a sense of social presence, enhancing the feeling of "talking to someone" rather than interacting with a machine. The visual aspects, including the 3D avatar, were seen as professional and friendly, but they did not significantly impact the perceived quality of information.

While most participants found the content beneficial, some expressed a desire for more diverse intervention techniques beyond ABA, suggesting that future versions of Glitter could incorporate a broader range of therapeutic approaches.

#### Challenges and Considerations for Future Development

Although Glitter demonstrated its potential as a practical tool for practitioners, the study highlighted several areas for improvement:
- **Prompting Quality**: Practitioners sometimes struggled to phrase queries effectively, impacting the quality of the agent’s responses. Training on how to interact with LLMs could help users maximize the agent's capabilities.
- **Language Nuances**: Some users felt that the language used in the responses was too formal or overly complex for parents and non-professionals.
- **Expanding Content Diversity**: While ABA forms the foundation of Glitter's guidance, integrating additional behavioral models could enhance its flexibility.

#### Empowering Caregivers and Other Stakeholders

Beyond practitioners, Glitter holds promise for other stakeholders, including parents, teachers in remote areas, and special education students. The platform could serve as a valuable resource for caregivers to learn about ABA and apply strategies in day-to-day scenarios. Similarly, educators in underserved regions could benefit from access to structured intervention guidance, while students studying special education could use the system to bridge the gap between theory and practical application.

#### Conclusion

Glitter stands out as an innovative step forward in digital behavioral health, blending structured learning with conversational AI to support autism interventions. By providing a user-friendly platform for ABA strategies, it empowers practitioners and caregivers to tackle the complexities of autism with confidence. The ongoing development of Glitter will continue to refine its capabilities, ensuring that it remains a vital tool for enhancing the quality of life for autistic children and their families.
